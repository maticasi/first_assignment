# first_assignment
Matilde Casagni 2018508

In this repository you will find the codes I made for the 1st assignement of POCS2 course.
I put all the answers in one jupyter notebook, each divided and titled so it's easier to identify them on Hackerrank.
There are :
  - Basic Data Types (5),
  - Strings (5),
  - Sets (6),
  - Math (4),
  - IterTools (4),
  - Collections (4)

For some categories I did more excercises to practice, so I put them too in the notebook.
